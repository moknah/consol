If you did not give us a real email address when you created your account, we cannot send you an email.
If your account did not have an email address or a credit card/PayPal purchase, we can still work with you to try to verify ownership and return the account.
Contact https://www.roblox.com/support if you need help getting back into your account.
These methods will only work if there was an email or phone number added to the account before you forgot the username. The only other way to locate the username is if you made a purchase on Roblox. Some purchase receipts include the username. Sadly, without an email, phone number, or purchase history there is no way to recover the account.
